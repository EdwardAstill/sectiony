## Result

Wrapper class for analysis results providing convenient access to (x, y) data pairs.

```python
from beamy import Result

class Result:
    def __init__(self, x: np.ndarray, values: np.ndarray):
        """
        Args:
            x: Array of x-coordinates
            values: Array of corresponding y-values
        """
```

### Properties

- `max` (float): Maximum value in the result
- `min` (float): Minimum value in the result
- `mean` (float): Mean value
- `range` (float): Range (max - min) of values

### Methods

#### `at(x_loc: float) -> float`

Interpolate the result at a specific x-location.

**Parameters:**
- `x_loc` (float): X-coordinate to evaluate at

**Returns:**
- `float`: Interpolated value at `x_loc`

### Usage

The `Result` class is iterable and can be indexed:

```python
# Iterate over (x, y) pairs
for x, y in result:
    print(f"x={x}, y={y}")

# Access by index
x, y = result[0]

# Get value at specific location
value = result.at(2.5)

# Get statistics
print(f"Max: {result.max}, Min: {result.min}, Mean: {result.mean}")
```

### Example

```python
import numpy as np
from beamy import Result

x = np.linspace(0, 5, 100)
y = np.sin(x)
result = Result(x, y)

print(result.max)      # Maximum value
print(result.at(2.5))  # Interpolated value at x=2.5
```

## AnalysisResult

Container for action, stress, and displacement results.

```python
from beamy import AnalysisResult

@dataclass
class AnalysisResult:
    _action: Result
    _stress: Result
    _displacement: Result
```

### Properties

- `action` (Result): Force or moment distribution (V, M, N, T)
- `stress` (Result): Stress distribution (sigma, tau)
- `displacement` (Result): Displacement distribution (w, u, theta)

### Example

```python
# Get analysis result from LoadedBeam
result = loaded_beam.shear(axis="z", points=100)

# Access action (shear force)
shear_force = result.action
print(shear_force.max)  # Maximum shear force

# Access stress (shear stress)
shear_stress = result.stress
print(shear_stress.at(2.5))  # Shear stress at x=2.5

# Access displacement
displacement = result.displacement
print(displacement.min)  # Minimum displacement
```

## Analysis Workflow

Typical workflow for analyzing a beam:

1. **Define beam geometry and properties**
   ```python
   beam = Beam1D(L=5.0, material=steel, section=section, supports=[...])
   ```

2. **Define loads**
   ```python
   lc = LoadCase(name="My Loads")
   lc.add_point_force(...)
   lc.add_distributed_force(...)
   ```

3. **Create LoadedBeam** (automatically solves for reactions)
   ```python
   loaded_beam = LoadedBeam(beam, lc)
   ```

4. **Perform analysis**
   ```python
   shear_result = loaded_beam.shear(axis="z", points=100)
   bending_result = loaded_beam.bending(axis="z", points=100)
   deflection = loaded_beam.deflection(axis="z", points=100)
   ```

5. **Access results**
   ```python
   max_shear = shear_result.action.max
   max_stress = bending_result.stress.max
   max_deflection = deflection.max
   value_at_x = shear_result.action.at(2.5)
   ```
